            The idea that all matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles, or atoms,
            is believed to have originated with the Greek philosopher Leucippus of Miletus and
            his student Democritus of Abdera in the 5th century B.C.
            (The word atom comes from the Greek word atomos, which means “indivisible.”)
            <br><br>
            While the idea of the atom was supported by some later Greek philosophers,
            it was fiercely attacked by others, including Aristotle, who argued against the existence of such particles.
            During the Middle Ages in Europe, Roman Catholic theologians were heavily influenced by Aristotle's ideas,
            and so atomic philosophy was largely dismissed for centuries. However, the Greeks' conception of the atom survived,
            both in Aristotle's works (his arguments against) and in another classical work by the Roman author Lucretius,
            De rerum natura (“On the Nature of Things”), which was rediscovered in Europe at the start of the Renaissance.

              The modern atomic theory, which has undergone continuous refinement,
              began to flourish at the beginning of the 19th century with the work of the English chemist John Dalton.
              The experiments of the British physicist Ernest Rutherford in the early 20th century on the scattering of
              alpha particles from a thin gold foil established the Rutherford atomic model of an atom as consisting of a central,
              positively charged nucleus containing nearly all the mass and surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged planetlike electrons.
              <br><br>
              With the advent of quantum mechanics and the Schrödinger equation in the 1920s, atomic theory became a precise mathematical science.
              Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger devised a partial differential equation for the quantum dynamics of atomic electrons,
              including the electrostatic repulsion of all the negatively charged electrons from each other and their attraction to the positively charged nucleus.
              The equation can be solved exactly for an atom containing only a single electron (hydrogen), and very close approximations can be found for atoms containing
              two or three electrons (helium and lithium). To the extent that the Schrödinger equation can be solved for more-complex cases,
              atomic theory is capable of predicting from first principles the properties of all atoms and their interactions.
              The recent availability of high-speed supercomputers to solve the Schrödinger equation has made possible accurate calculations of properties for atoms
              and molecules with ever larger numbers of electrons. Precise agreement with experiment is obtained if small corrections due to the effects of the theory of
              special relativity and quantum electrodynamics are also included.
