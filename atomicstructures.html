              An atom consists of a positively charged nucleus,
              surrounded by one or more negatively charged particles called electrons.
              The positive charges equal the negative charges, so the atom has no overall charge;
              it is electrically neutral. Most of an atom’s mass is in its nucleus;
              the mass of an electron is only 1/1836 the mass of the lightest nucleus, that of hydrogen.
              Although the nucleus is heavy, it is quite small compared with the overall size of an atom.
              <br><br>
              There were several proposals in representing on how atomic structures looked: Namely, the
              cubic model (1902), the plum-pudding model (1904), the Saturnian model (1904),
              the Rutherford model (1911), and the Bohr model (1913).

            The cubical atom was an early atomic model in which electrons were positioned
            at the eight corners of a cube in a non-polar atom or molecule.
            This theory was developed in 1902 by Gilbert N. Lewis and published in 1916
            in the article "The Atom and the Molecule" and used to account for the phenomenon of valency.

            The plum pudding model is one of several historical scientific models of the atom.
            First proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1904 soon after the discovery of the electron,
            but before the discovery of the atomic nucleus, the model tried to explain two properties
            of atoms then known: that electrons are negatively-charged particles and that atoms have no net electric charge.
            The plum pudding model has electrons surrounded by a volume of positive charge,
            like negatively-charged "plums" embedded in a positively-charged "pudding".

            The Rutherford model was devised by Ernest Rutherford to describe an atom.
            Rutherford directed the famous Geiger–Marsden experiment in 1909 which suggested,
            upon Rutherford's 1911 analysis, that J. J. Thomson's plum pudding model of the atom was incorrect.
            Rutherford's new model for the atom, based on the experimental results,
            contained new features of a relatively high central charge concentrated into a
            very small volumein comparison to the rest of the atom and with this central volume also containing
            the bulk of the atomic mass of the atom. This region would be known as the "nucleus" of the atom.

            The Rutherford–Bohr model or Bohr model or Bohr diagram, presented by Niels Bohr and Ernest Rutherford in 1913,
            is a system consisting of a small, dense nucleus surrounded by revolving electrons
            —similar to the structure of the Solar System, but with attraction provided by electrostatic forces rather than gravity.
